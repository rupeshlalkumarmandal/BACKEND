Getting started with Node.js is straightforward! Here’s a step-by-step guide for setting it up and practicing the basics.

### 1. **Install Node.js**
   - Download the latest Node.js version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - After downloading, install it using the standard setup process for your operating system.
   - Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
     This will display the version number of Node.js you installed.

### 2. **Create a New Project Directory**
   - Create a folder for your project, and open it in your terminal:
     ```bash
     mkdir my-first-node-project
     cd my-first-node-project
     ```

### 3. **Initialize the Project with `npm init`**
   - Node.js includes `npm` (Node Package Manager), which manages packages and dependencies for your project.
   - Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file, which tracks your project’s dependencies and configuration:
     ```bash
     npm init
     ```
   - `npm init` will ask several questions about your project (like project name, version, description, etc.). You can press **Enter** to accept the defaults for now, or fill them out as needed.
   - You’ll see a `package.json` file in your project folder. This file keeps track of packages your project uses, scripts you can run, and other configuration settings.

### 4. **Install Your First Package Using `npm install`**
   - `npm install` helps you add packages (or libraries) to your project.
   - Try installing a simple package like `lodash`, a popular JavaScript utility library:
     ```bash
     npm install lodash
     ```
   - This creates a `node_modules` folder where packages and dependencies are stored, and `lodash` will be listed in the `package.json` file under “dependencies”.

### 5. **Run a Basic Node.js Script**
   - Create a new file named `index.js` in your project folder. This will be your main JavaScript file.
   - Open `index.js` and write a simple `console.log()` statement to test if everything is set up:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
     ```
   - Run the script with Node.js:
     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```
   - You should see "Hello, Node.js!" printed in the terminal.

### Additional Practice: Learn Basic Commands

- **`npm install <package>`**: Installs a specific package.
- **`npm install -g <package>`**: Installs a package globally, making it available across projects.
- **`npm start`**: Runs the command listed in `package.json` under `"scripts"` with the key `"start"`.
- **`npm install --save <package>`**: Adds a package to dependencies (automatically saved with the latest npm versions).
